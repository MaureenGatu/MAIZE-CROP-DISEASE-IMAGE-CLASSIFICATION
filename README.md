# MAIZE-CROP-DISEASE-IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION

## Business Overview.

### Overview.

Maize is a cereal plant that yields large grains (corn or sweetcorn) set in rows on a cob. The leafy stalk of the plant produces pollen inflorescences and separate ovuliferous inflorescences called ears that yield kernels or seeds, which are fruits. Maize matures after 3-4 months especially for the short season varieties with others going up to 10 months or more. Harvesting can be done while the maize is green or when dry. Cobs are harvested by hand or by use of mechanized harvesters e.g. combine harvesters.
In Kenya, Maize provides a basic diet to millions of people.  The total land area under maize production is about 1.5 million hectares, with an annual average production estimated at 3.0 million metric tons, giving a national mean yield of 2 metric tons per hectare.  Typically, yields range from 4 to 8 T/Ha in the high potential highlands of Kenya, representing only 50% (or less) of the genetic potentials of the hybrids.  Highland maize varieties are grown on some 40-50% of the total maize area, representing 600,000 - 800,000 Ha.
Maize production has not kept pace with the population increase, although breeders and agronomists have exploited its genetic potential for yield. Constraints for maize production include drought, low soil fertility, pests, and diseases. Foliar (leaf) and stalk/ear rot diseases and stem-borers cause great losses in maize production in the humid transitional and high tropics of Kenya. Crop protectionists have put tremendous effort into identifying the disease and pest problems. Some of the most common types of maize diseases affecting Kenyan farmers include Downy mildew, Northern Corn (Turcicum), Southern leaf blight, gray leaf spot (GLS), Common rust, Common smut, Head Smut, Maize lethal necrosis 
disease, and Maize streak virus. 

### Problem Statement.

Maize production has not kept pace with the population increase, although breeders and agronomists have exploited its genetic potential for yield.
Constraints for maize production include drought, low soil fertility, pests, and diseases. Foliar (leaf) and stalk/ear rot diseases and stem-borers cause great losses in 
maize production in the humid transitional and high tropics of Kenya. Developing techniques to accurately classify crop leaf disease categories is critical for disease prevention. 
Computer vision can be useful by building a model that can identify the various types of maize crop diseases and classify them accurately.

### Objectives.

Our main objective for this study will be to provide a system that can be used by farmers to identify the kind of disease affecting their maize crop and offer possible solutions and remedies to fight the disease and prevent it from spreading.
Specific objectives:
1. To determine the modelâ€™s overall effectiveness in classifying diseases using both validation and test dataset.
2. To identify the specific features that differentiate the different kinds of maize crop diseases.
3. To differentiate between pest infestation and other diseases.
4. Deploy the trained model to create an easy-to-use web application.
